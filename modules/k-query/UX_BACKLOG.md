# UX Backlog

1. [Done] Element & synonym editor table (include/exclude, immediate query update)
2. [Done] Query breadth slider (phrase vs token balance, synonym count)
3. [Done] Per-layer rerun buttons (Layer 1/2/3 selective rerun)
4. [Done] Query preview highlight (color-coded groups)
5. [Planned] Issue warnings (over-quoting, too few synonyms)
6. [Planned] Domain dictionary UI (user-managed synonym seed list)
7. [Planned] History diff view (compare past vs current query)
8. [Planned] Export options (query-only or JSON bundle)
